An enthusiastic BSc Data Science student with a passion for technology, innovation, and problem-solving. Always eager to explore new horizons, I dive into projects that merge technical knowledge with creativity, whether in machine learning, data science, or web development.

I’ve built a range of impactful applications, from interactive weather apps to machine learning models for disaster management, striving to make tech solutions both accessible and meaningful. Driven by a love for hands-on work, I’ve developed projects like breast cancer detection using AI, an inventory management tool, and a Medical Equipment Allocator optimized with advanced graph algorithms.

Beyond the classroom, I actively participate in conferences and hackathons, collaborating with like-minded peers to transform complex challenges into real-world solutions. With a strong foundation in software development and a commitment to continual learning, I’m ready to contribute meaningfully in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
